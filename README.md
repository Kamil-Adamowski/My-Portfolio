## General info
My portfolio website serves as a showcase of my skills and projects as a frontend developer. It was designed to provide a clean, user-friendly experience that highlights my expertise in modern web development. The site includes sections for featured projects. Each project is presented with a description, and links to repositories, offering a comprehensive view of my work. It was built using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, React Router for navigation and Tailwind CSS for styling.
